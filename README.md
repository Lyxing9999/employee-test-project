 # Employee Management System (My First Project)

This is a simple web application I created as my first project to practice my **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** skills. It's a basic **Employee Management System** that allows managers to:

- **Add new employees** to the system.
- **Calculate salary**: Use the Salary Calculator to compute an employee's net salary after tax deductions.

I wanted to make sure the app looks good on any screen, so I made it **responsive**. This way, it works well on both desktops and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the pages of the application.
- **CSS**: Styled the app to make it look clean and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Added functionality like adding employees and performing salary calculations.

## Features
- **Add Employees**: Fill in the employee’s details and add them to the system.
- **Salary Calculator**: Input an employee’s salary and tax rate to see their net salary after deductions.
- **Responsive Design**: The app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
